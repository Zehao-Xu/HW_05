    "Imagine you want to estimate the average height of the population of an entire country (¬µ), and since it is impossible to measure the height of every individual, you can select a subset of the population to serve as your sample(ùë•) and measure the average of their heights (¬µ0) to predict the average height of the population of the entire country. When we do a hypothesis test, we predict the average height of the population by measuring the average height of the sample, and that prediction is the hypothesized mean. The key point here is that we are not interested in the average height of the sample, but in predicting the average height of the population."

And we can decide if there is a true effect or difference by looking at where the p-value is in the sampling distribution, and the p-value is the area under this curve, the size of the p-value determines the probability that we will get a result where the null hypothesis is true, and if the p-value is very small, it means that our actual results are different from our expected results, which makes us wonder if the null hypothesis is wrong."
